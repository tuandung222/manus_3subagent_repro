## Suggested Reading Sequence

1. Start with `REPRODUCTION_PLAN.md` for scope and success criteria.
2. Continue with architecture documents for control-flow and runtime contracts.
3. Review tracing plans for data lineage and training export strategy.
4. Finish with notebook guides for hands-on experimentation.
